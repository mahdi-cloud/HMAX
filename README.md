The advancement of deep artificial neural networks has been greatly influenced by the primate visual system, marking a significant breakthrough in computer vision. However, these networks exhibit lower energy efficiency compared to their biological counterparts and often rely on data-intensive backpropagation for training. In an effort to overcome these challenges, we implemented a Multi-layer convolutional spiking neural network employing a latency-coding scheme. Training involved a combination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Additionally, we introduced a straightforward neural layer featuring 10 neurons for MNIST digit classification, employing reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP).
