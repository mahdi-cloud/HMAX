# Bio-inspired digit recognition using reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity using 1 layer convolutional networks

he primate visual system has inspired the development of deep artificial neural networks, which have revolutionized the computer vision domain. Yet these networks are much less energy-efficient than their biological counterparts, and they are typically trained with backpropagation, which is extremely data-hungry. To address these limitations, we used a one layer convolutional spiking neural network and a latency-coding scheme. We trained it using a combination of spike-timingdependent plasticity (STDP). Also, we put a simple neural layer with 10 neurons to classify MNIST digits by reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP).
